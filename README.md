BioInformatics from Coursera
This is a list of the functions completed in the BioInformatics Course from Coursera. 

The goal of the Course: 
-Learn the basics of Python programming and make some simple algorithms to try and find the origin of replication in small genomes.
-Learn which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks. The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?
