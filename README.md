# BioInformatics Course 1- Programs
BioInformatics from Coursera
This is a list of the functions completed in the BioInformatics Course from Coursera. 

## The goal of the course: 

-Learn the basics of Python programming and make some simple algorithms to try and find the origin of replication in small genomes.

-Learn which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks. The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?

### Python Concepts (CodeAcademy and Stepik interactive lessons):
1. Python Syntax
2. Strings and Console Output
3. Conditionals and Control Flow
4. Functions
5. Lists and Dictionaries
6. Lists and Functions
7. Loops
8. Advanced Topics in Python
9. Introduction to Classes
10. File input and output

### Applications
####Finding the Origin of Replication in a Genome is important for many reasons. For example:

The idea of gene therapy is to intentionally infect a patient who lacks a crucial gene with a viral vector containing an artificial gene that encodes a therapeutic protein. Once inside the cell, the vector replicates and eventually produces many molecules of the therapeutic protein, which in turn treats the patient’s disease. To ensure that the vector actually replicates inside the cell, biologists must know where ori is in the vector’s genome and ensure that the genetic manipulations that they perform do not affect it.
